More than ever, our ambition is to establish\n                           Marie Brizard Wine & Spirits as a player at the very heart of the wine and spirits\n                           market, and this first year of implementation confirms that it is our rightful place,\n                           with a positioning that perfectly matches the expectations of our customers.

This\n                           will represent the final element in our Group\u2019s normalization.\"I.UPWARD REVISION IN\n                           OUR FINANCIAL TARGETS CONFIRMEDReviewing our strategic work has allowed us to confirm the upward revision in the\n                           Group\u2019s 2018 financial targets, in terms of both sales and EBITDA:\u2022 Sales of between \u20ac450 and 500m _versus \u20ac420 to 460m indicated in BiG 1.0_\u2022 EBITDA margin of 15% _versus a bracket of 12% to 15% in BiG 1.0_, i.e. EBITDA of\n                           between \u20ac67 and 75m _versus a bracket of \u20ac50 to 70m in BiG 1.0_\u2022 Revenue from the divestment of non-strategic assets of over \u20ac40m _versus \u20ac20m in\n                           BiG 1.0_\u2022 Cumulative self-financed investments of \u20ac50 to 60m between 2015 and 2018 _unchanged\n                           from BiG 1.0_II.2015: RESULTS IN LINE WITH OUR STRATEGIC PLAN, ACCELERATION IN PROFITABILITYWhilst 2014 was a year devoted to cleaning up the Group\u2019s operations, 2015 was the\n                           first year of implementation of its strategic plan.

The Board\n                           has also taken note of Mr. Jacques Bourbousson\u2019s decision at the sitting to stand\n                           down, as well as the withdrawal of the candidacies of Mr. Beuchet and Mr. Gailly as\n                           new Board members. In these conditions, the resolutions in question will be the subject of a withdrawal\n                           amendment tabled by the Shareholders\u2019 Meeting\u2019s Officers.  The Board would like to point out that, as a result, the resolutions on the agenda\n                           of the Shareholders\u2019 Meeting concerning the dismissal of Board members are no longer\n                           relevant.In the interest of the Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re group, the Board of Directors welcomes this solution\n                           and considers that the agreement on the desired composition of the Board reflects\n                           a fair balance between independent Board members and representatives of its main shareholders\n                           that will enable the Group to have on its Board all the necessary areas of expertise\n                           it needs to accelerate the BiG 2018 strategic plan.About Belv\u00e9d\u00e8reBelv\u00e9d\u00e8re is a wine and spirits group operating in Europe and the United States.

Indeed, its\n                           financial, marketing or advertising know-how would not be sufficiently represented\n                           on the Board, unlike all the major listed wine and spirits groups in the world.o\tAppointment of Mr. Serge Heringer as a new Board memberThis request has not been approved, as the Board considers that the resolution regarding\n                           the appointment of DF Holding as a new Board member has already been approved and\n                           the appointment of an additional representative of Diana Holding would lead to the\n                           Diana Holding - DF Holding grouping being overly represented on the Board with regard\n                           to their stakes.o\tDelegation of power to be granted to the Board of Directors for the purpose of issuing\n                           additional stock warrants, without preferential subscription rights for shareholders,\n                           for holders of the old stock warrants tendered within the framework of the public\n                           exchange offerThis request has been approved, as the Board considers that this delegation of power\n                           could be in the Company\u2019s interest by providing it with financing via the exercise\n                           of such stock warrants. o\tModification of article 27 II of the Statutes \u2013 Double voting rights This request has not been approved, as the Board considers that reducing the timeframe\n                           required to obtain double voting rights would exclusively benefit certain shareholders.\n                           \u2022\tResolutions requested by SPC LUX SARLIn a letter dated 5 June 2015, SPC Lux S\u00e0rl, indicating that it has a stake of at\n                           least 4.80% in the Company, asked the Board to put the following resolutions on the\n                           agenda of the next Shareholders\u2019 Meeting:o\tRevocation of Mrs. Rita Maria Zniber, Mr. Mehdi Bouchaara and Mr. Jacques Bourbousson\n                           as Board membersThese requests have been approved, as the Board believes that it should be up to the\n                           Shareholders\u2019 Meeting to fully define the Board\u2019s composition and that all Board members\n                           should therefore place their mandates at the disposal of the Company\u2019s shareholders.About Belv\u00e9d\u00e8reBelv\u00e9d\u00e8re is a wine and spirits group operating in Europe and the United States.

Indeed, the representatives of Groupe Diana Holding _a 17.31% shareholder_ having,\n                           on 20 May 2015, informed the AMF of a joint action with DF Holding, a Castel group\n                           company _5.66% shareholder_, they have called for four independent Board members \u2013\n                           Mrs. Christine Mondollot, Mrs. Constance Benqu\u00e9, Mr. Beno\u00eet Ghiot and Mr. Beno\u00eet H\u00e9rault,\n                           the Chairman of the Board \u2013 to  stand down with a view to the co-opting of four new\n                           members, namely DF Holding represented by Mrs. Laurence Dequatre and three independent\n                           Board members: Mr. Guillaume De Belair, Mr. Nicolas Gailly and Mr. Pierre Beuchet.It should be noted that, since the arrival of the four independent Board members who\n                           have been asked to stand down, numerous measures have been instigated that have enabled\n                           Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re to normalise its situation. In particular:\u2022 A new senior management team has been put in place, headed by CEO Mr. Jean-No\u00ebl\n                           Reynaud, with a renewed executive committee,\u2022 The Company\u2019s internal organisation has been overhauled in order to align it with\n                           the industry\u2019s best standards,\u2022 A new BIG _Back In the Game_ 2018 strategic plan has been initiated,\u2022 The financial situation has been strengthened,\u2022 New internal control procedures have been implemented this year enabling the Company\n                           to publish annual accounts that were certified without any qualifications for the\n                           first time in six years.Within this context, and given the Company\u2019s shareholder split, the independent Board\n                           members indicated above feel that, having been appointed by the Shareholders\u2019 Meeting,\n                           it is up to the latter to define the composition of the Company\u2019s management bodies\n                           and the control of its governance, and not up to certain Board members. They have\n                           therefore indicated that they are standing down, a decision that will come into effect\n                           following the next Shareholders\u2019 Meeting, and will place their mandate at the disposal\n                           of the Company\u2019s shareholders.The independent Board members in question, whose resignation\n                           will come into effect at the end of the upcoming Shareholders\u2019 Meeting, will therefore\n                           let the latter decide, and will stand again in the shareholder vote for a new mandate.\n                           Following a majority vote, the Board of Directors refused to immediately co-opt DF\n                           Holding _the Castel group\u2019s main holding company_ to fill the final seat on the Board,\n                           preferring to put this appointment to the next Shareholders\u2019 Meeting, and has therefore\n                           agreed on a new set of resolutions to be put to the Shareholders\u2019 Meeting of 30 June.\n                           As well as the reappointment of the independent Board members mentioned above, the\n                           Board will therefore notably ask the Shareholders\u2019 Meeting to approve the following\n                           Board member appointments:- DF Holding _Castel group_, without the number of representatives of the declared\n                           grouping with Diana Holding _23% stake_ exceeding a third of the total number of Board\n                           members _the grouping wanted to have half of the seats_; and- Mr. Guillaume De Belair, representative of the Company\u2019s individual shareholders,\n                           a candidate at the last Shareholders\u2019 Meeting, subject to his approval.About Belv\u00e9d\u00e8reBelv\u00e9d\u00e8re is a wine and spirits group operating in Europe and the United States.

The reason this new name is being put forward is\n                           that it illustrates what the Group is today, and notably:- A clear mission in line with the Marie Brizard brand\u2019s DNA: to offer its clients\n                           trustworthy, audacious and flavorful brands,- A shared desire by all staff, the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee\n                           to move forward within a new framework and create a shared corporate culture based\n                           on innovation and growth,- A multi-region and multi-category wine and spirits Group rooted in a tradition that\n                           began in Bordeaux back in 1755,- Brands with recognised savoir faire,- An international standing highlighted by the term \u201cWine & Spirits\" being in English.Jean-No\u00ebl Reynaud, CEO of Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re, says: \u201cThe unreserved approval of our accounts\n                           is excellent news, and I would like to congratulate all of the teams who accomplished\n                           work of real quality to achieve this. The auditors thoroughly reviewed our accounts\n                           and were able to note the tighter internal control and operational control we have\n                           put in place. Lastly, the planned change in the Group\u2019s name is the final step in\n                           the normalisation plan that we launched a year ago, and it is of course quite right\n                           that our shareholders should have their say in this matter.

In the United States, MBWS consolidates its partnership with Southern Glazers Wine\n                           & Spirits in 30 states, and across all its portfolio, with the renewal of its contract\n                           from January 1st, 2017. MBWS also sealed a partnership with Empire Merchants, to entrust\n                           it with the distribution of its brands for the state of New York.These two agreements enhance our growth and distribution focus for the Sobieski brand\n                           in the United States, and also support our enhanced ambitions for the Group's other\n                           pillar brands.2. In Asia, after the establishment of two offices in Japan and Hong Kong earlier\n                           this year, MBWS announced the signature of a strategic partnership with COFCO in China.\n                           COFCO, China\u2019s largest agro-alimentary company, will import and distribute William\n                           Peel, Sobieski and Marie Brizard in the People\u2019s Republic of China _PRC_, as of December\n                           2016. The aim for both parties is to build leading positions of the three brands in\n                           the market. This partnership confirms the relevance of MBWS\u2019 business model, based\n                           on the \u2018mainstreamization\u2019 of the Chinese market. In addition, the group has signed a distribution agreement with HLX for Cognac Gautier\n                           in China, Cognac\u2019s second largest market globally, following the relaunch of the brand\n                           earlier this year. Also linked to Asia, MBWS announces agreements in several countries, including France,\n                           for the distribution of the Japanese brand Choya, leader of the Umeshu category.In view of these significant changes in the route-to-market, Asia becomes a full-fledged\n                           cluster. 3. In Morocco, MBWS announces the beginning of the distribution of its brands by its\n                           industrial shareholder, the Diana Holding Group, through its subsidiary Ebertec, a\n                           leader in the distribution of wines and spirits in the country. This distribution\n                           agreement is the precursor to a joint strengthening of the companies\u2019 route-to-market\n                           on the African continent.4. In the UK, MBWS announces the strengthening of its partnership with Conviviality\n                           PLC, the UK\u2019s leading independent drinks distributor. Building on the success of Marie\n                           Brizard, which has become the UK\u2019s No.1 fruit Liqueur brand in the on-trade in less\n                           than 5 years, this renewed partnership aims to accelerate not only the growth of its eponymous brand, but also\n                           includes the Cognac Gautier and Sobieski vodka brands.5. In Poland, as announced last week, MBWS is expanding its strategic partnership\n                           with Eurocash, the largest distributor of fast moving consumer goods _FMCG_ to the\n                           traditional trade. The agreement will take full effect from January 1st, 2017, and\n                           will enable the Group to strengthen the presence of its flagship brands \u2013 specifically\n                           Krupnik and William Peel - in the traditional trade, which accounts for 50% of the\n                           Polish market. Alongside this partnership, MBWS has strengthened the distribution reach of Sobieski\n                           Trade, its wholly-owned wholesale network for the traditional trade, via an agreement\n                           with Coca-Cola HBC Polska. As part of this deal, Sobieski Trade will distribute the\n                           major brands of The Coca-Cola Company - including Coca-Cola, Fanta, Sprite, Nestea,\n                           Burn and Powerade \u2013 to Poland\u2019s traditional trade. This partnership will expand MBWS\u2019\n                           distribution network in Poland, and should consequently increase the availability\n                           of its products in traditional trade outlets across the country.These partnerships collectively confirm MBWS\u2019 growth model, support the attainment\n                           of the company\u2019s objectives, and reconfirm MBWS\u2019 position in the wine and spirits\n                           industry. The strengthening of distribution networks, in several key markets, completes the\n                           road-to-market optimization project and allows the Group to focus on the growth component\n                           of its BiG 2018 strategic plan, which will be updated on December 12, 2016.About Marie Brizard Wine & Spirits _MBWS_Marie Brizard Wine & Spirits produces and sells a range of wine and spirits primarily\n                           in Europe and the United States.

At a hearing held on 14 June, the Group subsidiaries involved thus asked the Dijon\n                           Commercial Court to ascertain their exit from their respective continuation plans.\n                           A decision is expected at the end of June.The Group is therefore more than ever focusing on lasting profitable growth through\n                           the execution of the BiG 2018 plan as its main priority. To achieve this, the Group\n                           has reorganized its teams.Stanislas Ronteix, until now the Group\u2019s Chief Sales & Marketing Officer, is thus\n                           appointed Deputy CEO of the Group, responsible for Distribution _excluding Eastern\n                           Europe_ and Marketing Strategies. Xavier Penas, formerly Sales Director, France within SCA, is appointed Managing Director\n                           of Marie Brizard Wine & Spirits France, responsible for Sales & Marketing activities.\n                           Stanislas de Parcevaux, previously Head of Marketing for Orangina Schweppes, is appointed\n                           Group Marketing and Digital Director.Xavier Penas and Stanislas de Parcevaux will report to Stanislas Ronteix.The Eastern Europe and Central Europe clusters are being grouped together within a\n                           single cluster headed by Juozas Daunys, who will also head Marie Brizard Wine & Spirits\n                           Polska. Given his success at the helm of the Eastern Europe cluster, mainly in Lithuania,\n                           Juozas Daunys will be able to give this new cluster the direction, impetus and energy\n                           needed for the Group to achieve its ambitions in this region. Juozas will report directly\n                           to Jean-Noel Reynaud.Marie Brizard Wine & Spirits also announces the arrival of Raquel Lizarraga, who has\n                           notably worked for Pepsico, as Head of Investor Relations and Ferid El Ketroussi,\n                           previously of Ernst & Young, as Head of Strategy and M&A. Both of them will report\n                           directly to Jean-Noel Reynaud. Lastly, St\u00e9phane Pedrazzi, until recently CNBC\u2019s Paris Correspondent and head of the\n                           Paris office, is appointed Communications Director and will report to St\u00e9phane Laugery,\n                           the Marie Brizard Wine & Spirits Group\u2019s Corporate Secretary. Jean-No\u00ebl Reynaud, CEO of Marie Brizard Wine & Spirits, comments: \u201cThis is a historic\n                           step. Indeed, MBWS and the Polish subsidiaries have requested their exit from their\n                           recovery plans five years ahead of the initial deadline. This is a major success that\n                           rewards the work carried out by all the Marie Brizard Wine & Spirits teams, its advisors\n                           and its judicial representatives, who have constantly strived to turn the Group around.\n                           This has now been achieved, and we should be proud of what we have accomplished. Our\n                           Group is beginning a new chapter in its development, a period of lasting profitable\n                           growth. Marie Brizard Wine & Spirits henceforth has the means to fulfill its ambitions,\n                           with structured and motivated teams and a clear strategic plan whose execution remains\n                           the Group\u2019s number 1 priority. The exit from the recovery plans, combined with our\n                           renewed financial means, open up new prospects and will notably enable us to address\n                           external growth opportunities, thus making Marie Brizard Wine & Spirits an offensive\n                           player in the wine and spirits industry.\"About Marie Brizard Wine & SpiritsMarie Brizard Wine & Spirits is a wine and spirits group operating in Europe and the\n                           United States.

You are reminded that each 2023 redeemable stock warrant has a maturity date of 31\n                           December 2023 and an exercise price of \u20ac25. These 2023 redeemable stock warrants will\n                           be listed, and can therefore be freely traded on the market. For information, the\n                           theoretical value of a 2023 redeemable stock warrant set at the time of the Public\n                           Exchange Offer was \u20ac4.30. This value was based on a stock market price of \u20ac19.83 and\n                           the market conditions at that time, which may have evolved since then.After 31 March 2016, holders of 2016 stock warrants who have not exercised them will\n                           retain their 2016 stock warrants giving them the right to subscribe, until 31 December\n                           2016, to Marie Brizard Wine & Spirits shares at a price of \u20ac20, but will lose the\n                           right to obtain the 2023 redeemable stock warrants.Holders of 2016 stock warrants who wish to exercise them early in order to obtain\n                           2023 redeemable stock warrants are urged not to wait until 31 March 2016 to do so,\n                           and indeed to exercise them some days before that date by contacting their financial\n                           intermediaries, in order to take into account potential delays associated with the\n                           exercise process.Following the latest positive news concerning the Group, and notably the amicable\n                           resolution of the dispute with Chamarr\u00e9 and especially the exit from the continuation\n                           plan of its main French subsidiary MBWS France, the Group\u2019s main shareholders, Diana\n                           Holding and Cofepp _La Martiniquaise_, have advised it that they will exercise a significant\n                           portion of the 2016 stock warrants they hold. If all 2016 stock warrants were exercised by 31 March 2016, 2,628,381 new ordinary\n                           shares would be issued _giving a dilution of slightly less than 10%_, 2,628,381 2023\n                           redeemable stock warrants would be created and the Group would record a cash inflow\n                           of \u20ac52.6 million.What are the terms and conditions of the exercise of 2016 warrants\n                           and the delivery of shares?To exercise their 2016 warrants, holders must make a request to the financial intermediary\n                           where their securities are held and pay the corresponding exercise price in cash.\n                           A transfer agent _Caceis Corporate Trust_ mandated by MBWS will carry out the centralization\n                           of these operations. The exercise date will correspond to the trading day on which\n                           the last of the conditions _1_, _2_ and _3_ below is fulfilled, if no later than 17:00\n                           _5 pm_ Paris time, or the following trading day if that condition is fulfilled after\n                           17:00 _5 pm_ Paris time: _1_ the transfer agent receives the exercise request transmitted by the financial\n                           intermediary through whose books the 2016 warrants are registered; _2_ the 2016 warrants are transferred to the transfer agent by the financial intermediary\n                           concerned;_3_ the cash sum corresponding to the exercise of the 2016 warrants is released. This\n                           sum is equal to the number of 2016 warrants exercised multiplied by the exercise price,\n                           to the nearest cent.The shares will be delivered no later than the fifth trading day following the date\n                           of exercise, i.e. 7 April 2016 at the latest.
