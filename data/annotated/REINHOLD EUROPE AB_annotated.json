Today, the two companies decided that Waxy's new car wash facility,\n                           which is also Scandinavia's largest, will open to the public on January 6, 2018.The facility, located in Smista 15 km south of Stockholm, becomes Scandinavia's largest\n                           car wash in abuilding of 3,000 sqm. The new car wash facility has a 60-meter wash tunnel with a\n                           capacity of onewashed car per minute and is equipped with technology currently used in more than\n                           70 countries.In connection with the opening of the car wash facility in Smista, Waxy launches a\n                           brand newBusiness model for car washes in Sweden. The model entitles the customer to pay a\n                           fixed monthly feefor free washes. The business model is governed by an automatic payment system that\n                           is linked to thevehicle registration plate.The Smista car wash facility has an incredible potential for both private and corporate\n                           customers. Now that wehave a set date, we can start with work on marketing and sales.For Reinhold Europe AB it is important to have an opening date for a new car wash\n                           facility in such ashort period of time after the acquisition of Waxy.The interest in Waxy International AB has been great since Reinhold Europe AB acquired\n                           thecompany and it is good for all parties that we now have a date that our shareholders,\n                           employees andpartners can look forward to. Now we can continue to assist Waxys Management with\n                           what it takes to keep our common goal for new car wash facilities in Sweden.Reinhold Europe AB goal is for Waxy to operate 225 car wash facilities in the Nordic\n                           region within thenext five years, and Waxy's management is currently working on the completion of several\n                           contractsfor new car wash facilities in densely populated areas in Sweden.
